Teiler
======
** this is not usable software at the moment **

Basically, make it simple to share files amongst different computers behind the same router.

It is meant to solve the problem of having a friend come over to your house who wants to share a large
set of files with you. He uses Windows, you use linux. Neither of you has any idea how to start up a file server or use SSH. 

How to install
--------------
1. Download the source

    `git clone https://github.com/derwolfe/teiler.git`

2. Make a virtualenv for the application ** this will be replaced with a distutils install **

    `mkvirtualenv teiler`

3. Install the dependencies with  

    `workon teiler && pip install  -r teilerpy/requirements.txt`



How to use
---------
The application is set up to run as either a client or a server. 
The server broadcasts the files and the client grabs them.

CD into the directory `teiler` then

to run as a server, type

`python teilerpy/src/app.py serve` 

or to run in client mode

`python teilerpy/src/app.py listen`
   
Overview of the implementation
------------------------------
1. a file server
2. a pinging device to discover the server
3. some sort of client

Design
------
It should be simple -- the server starts, broadcasts it's address. The client picks up the address and grabs the files.

Testing levels
--------------
1. fileserver serves files
2. server seends out messages
3. client hears messages
4. client parses messages
5. client makes connection
6. client downloads file
7. Then gui
8. Then authenticate
